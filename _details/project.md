> We will need you to submit all your code as a final deliverable. PLAGIARISM will be strictly penalized, see [here](https://swabhs.com/f24-csci544-appliednlp/details/policies/#policy-for-the-use-of-ai-generators) for more details.

### Project proposal (4%).

Student teams should submit a ~1-page proposal (using the [*CL paper submission template](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files)) for their project by Week 5. The proposal should:
  - state and motivate the problem by providing a problem or task definition (preferably with example inputs and expected outputs),
  - situate the problem within related work (this might help you find sources of data for training a model for your task),
      - Related work: publications, start by looking in the [ACL anthology](https://aclanthology.org/)
      - References do not count towards page limit, but please follow the correct format
  - state a hypothesis to be verified and how to verify it (evaluation framework), and
  - provide a brief description of the approach to be followed to verify the hypothesis (such as proposed models and baselines).

We highly encourage students to work towards a problem involving predictive models, hence it's worth thinking about the five key ingredients of supervised learning: data, model, loss function, optimization algorithm and inference / evaluation.

### Project progress report (8%).

Student teams should submit a ~3-page progress report (using the [*CL paper submission template](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files)) for their project by the end of Week 8. This report should:
  - once again describe the projectâ€™s goals (it is okay if this has changed since the proposal),
  - contain all details on the dataset (your dataset should mostly be collected by now),
  - contain some initial results (think of this as a motivating result), and
  - must outline a concrete plan of what will be done for the final report.

While the initial results might be inconclusive, you are expected to have made non-trivial progress by this point. The project proposal may be extended for this report. Please take into consideration the earlier feedback you received, and address those inline (you may highlight these in a different text color if you wish to draw the grader's attention).


### Project final presentation (10%).

Instructions coming soon.



### Project final report (18%).

Instructions coming soon.



*All written assignments related to the final project should use the standard [*ACL paper submission template](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files).
