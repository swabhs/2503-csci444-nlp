### Project proposal (4%).

Student teams should submit a ~1-page proposal (using the [*CL paper submission template](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files)) for their project by Week 5. The proposal should:
  - state and motivate the problem by providing a problem or task definition (ideally with example inputs and expected outputs),
  - situate the problem within related work (this might help you find sources of data for training a model for your task),
  - state a hypothesis to be verified and how to verify it (evaluation framework), and
  - a brief description of the approach to be followed to verify the hypothesis (such as proposed models and baselines).

### Project progress report (8%).

Instructions coming soon.


### Project final presentation (10%).

Instructions coming soon.



### Project final report (18%).

Instructions coming soon.



*All written assignments related to the final project should use the standard [*ACL paper submission template](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files).
