#### Learning Objectives

This course is designed to give students an overview of some of the current challenges in NLP, and how a data-centric view of the field can help address these challenges. Students will get hands-on experience on developing analytical tools for investigating datasets, via the class project. Moreover, students are expected to come away with skills on reading research papers, and critical thinking on current NLP practices, as well as communicating their research questions and proposed solutions.


Discussion topics include:

* [How datasets are typically created in NLP.](#datasets-in-nlp/)
* [Biases in NLP datasets and mitigation strategies.](#biases-and-mitigation/)
* [Data quality estimation](#estimating-data-quality/)
* [Augmenting Existing Datasets](#augmenting-existing-datasets/)
* [Datasets for Accountability and Evaluation](#data-accountability/)
* [Beyond labeled datasets](#beyond-labeled-datasets-in-nlp/)
