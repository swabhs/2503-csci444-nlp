Natural language processing (NLP) has been revolutionized by the advancement of large-scale language models achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide variety of tasks. This course will cover the fundamentals of language modeling and related topics in natural language processing, deep learning and machine learning. Students will gain familiarity with the capabilities of large language models as well as get hands-on experience with building and evaluating small-scale language models. The class will also explore the real-world consequences of deploying language models, such as the ethics and harms associated with them . ",

Missed quizzes will receive a zero grade, and there will be no make-up quizzes. | . | Class Projects (40%). | Each student will do a group class project based on the topics covered in the class. Students will propose their own project, do the research and build a proof-of-concept, create a video demonstration of the proof-of-concept, and present the project in their report. | Proposal: 4% | Status Reports: 8% | Project Presentation: 10% | Final Write-up: 18% | . | Paper Presentations (5%). | The project teams will present a scientific publication related to their project to the class. All members of the team are expected to identify the central points of the research, and present that research to the class, as well as answer questions from the instructor and fellow students. | . | Exams (25%) . | Midterm (10%): The midterm exam will contain a mixture of multiple choice and long form questions, covering about the first half of the material covered in the class. | Final (15%): The final exam at the end of the semester covering all of the material covered in the class will contain a mixture of multiple choice and long form questions. | . | . Grading inquiries and questions about the grading of the homeworks and the quizzes can be asked (to the TAs) within two weeks from the grading date. Grades will be available within 2-2.5 weeks after submission. All written assignments related to the final project should use the standard *ACL paper submission template. ",

    "title": "Academic Policies",
    "content": "Academic conduct. Plagiarism ‚Äì presenting someone else‚Äôs ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words ‚Äì is a serious academic offense with serious consequences. Please familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism in SCampus in Part B, Section 11, ‚ÄúBehavior Violating University Standards‚Äù. Other forms of academic dishonesty are equally unacceptable. See additional information in SCampus and university policies on Research and Scholarship Misconduct. Accommodations. USC welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University‚Äôs educational programs. The Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS) is responsible for the determination of appropriate accommodations for students who encounter disability-related barriers. Once a student has completed the OSAS process (registration, initial appointment, and submitted documentation) and accommodations are determined to be reasonable and appropriate, a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) will be available to generate for each course. The LOA must be given to each course instructor by the student and followed up with a discussion. This should be done as early in the semester as possible as accommodations are not retroactive. More information can be found at osas.usc.edu. You may contact OSAS at (213) 740-0776 or via email at osasfrontdesk@usc.edu. Academic Integrity . The University of Southern California is foremost a learning community committed to fostering successful scholars and researchers dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and the transmission of ideas. Academic misconduct is in contrast to the university‚Äôs mission to educate students through a broad array of first-rank academic, professional, and extracurricular programs and includes any act of dishonesty in the submission of academic work (either in draft or final form). This course will follow the expectations for academic integrity as stated in the USC Student Handbook. All students are expected to submit assignments that are original work and prepared specifically for the course/section in this academic term. You may not submit work written by others or ‚Äúrecycle‚Äù work prepared for other courses without obtaining written permission from the instructor(s). Students suspected of engaging in academic misconduct will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity. Other violations of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication (e.g., falsifying data), knowingly assisting others in acts of academic dishonesty, and any act that gains or is intended to gain an unfair academic advantage. The impact of academic dishonesty is far-reaching and is considered a serious offense against the university and could result in outcomes such as failure on the assignment, failure in the course, suspension, or even expulsion from the university. For more information about academic integrity see the student handbook or the Office of Academic Integrity‚Äôs website, and university policies on Research and Scholarship Misconduct. Policy for the use of AI Generators . Generative AI permitted but limited as follows: In this course, you are permitted to use artificial intelligence (AI)- powered programs to help you, but only on assignments that explicitly indicate a permitted use of AI. However: . | You should also be aware that AI text generation tools may present incorrect information, biased responses, and incomplete analyses; thus, their answers may not meet the standards of this course. | To adhere to our university values, you must cite any AI-generated material (e.g., text, images, and other content) included or referenced in your work and provide the prompts used to generate the content. Using an AI tool to generate content without proper attribution will be treated as plagiarism and reported to the Office of Academic Integrity. | . Please review the instructions in each assignment for more details on how and when to use AI Generators for your submissions. Policy on Plagiarism and Collaboration . Please ask the instructor if you are unsure about what constitutes unauthorized assistance on an exam or assignment, or what information requires citation and/or attribution. Collaboration. In this class, you are expected to submit work that demonstrates your individual mastery of the course concepts. Group work. Unless specifically designated as a ‚Äògroup project,‚Äô all assignments are expected to be completed individually. Work by others or Generative AI. Plagiarism includes the submission of code or assignments written by, or otherwise obtained from someone else or generative AI. If found responsible for an academic violation, students may be assigned university outcomes, such as suspension or expulsion from the university, and grade penalties, such as an ‚ÄúF‚Äù grade on the assignment, exam, and/or in the course. Course Content Distribution and Synchronous Session Recordings Policies . USC has policies that prohibit recording and distribution of any synchronous and asynchronous course content outside of the learning environment. Recording a university class without the express permission of the instructor and announcement to the class, or unless conducted pursuant to an Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS) accommodation. Recording can inhibit free discussion in the future, and thus infringe on the academic freedom of other students as well as the instructor. (Living our Unifying Values: The USC Student Handbook, page 13). Distribution or use of notes, recordings, exams, or other intellectual property, based on university classes or lectures without the express permission of the instructor for purposes other than individual or group study. This includes but is not limited to providing materials for distribution by services publishing course materials. This restriction on unauthorized use also applies to all information, which had been distributed to students or in any way had been displayed for use in relation to the class, whether obtained in class, via email, on the internet, or via any other media. (Living our Unifying Values: The USC Student Handbook, page 13). ",
