<p><strong>Plagiarism</strong> – presenting someone else’s ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words – is a serious academic offense with serious consequences.
Please familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism in SCampus in <a href="policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b">Part B, Section 11, “Behavior Violating University Standards”</a>.
Other forms of academic dishonesty are equally unacceptable.
See additional information in SCampus and university policies on Research and Scholarship Misconduct.</p>

      </h3>
    
<p>USC welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University’s educational programs. The Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS) is responsible for the determination of appropriate accommodations for students who encounter disability-related barriers. Once a student has completed the OSAS process (registration, initial appointment, and submitted documentation) and accommodations are determined to be reasonable and appropriate, a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) will be available to generate for each course. The LOA must be given to each course instructor by the student and followed up with a discussion. This should be done as early in the semester as possible as accommodations are not retroactive. More information can be found at osas.usc.edu. You may contact OSAS at (213) 740-0776 or via email at osasfrontdesk@usc.edu.</p>

      </h3>
    
<p>The University of Southern California is foremost a learning community committed to fostering successful scholars and researchers dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and the transmission of ideas. Academic misconduct is in contrast to the university’s mission to educate students through a
broad array of first-rank academic, professional, and extracurricular programs and includes any act
of dishonesty in the submission of academic work (either in draft or final form).</p>

<p>This course will follow the expectations for academic integrity as stated in the <a href="https://policy.usc.edu/studenthandbook/">USC Student Handbook</a>. All students are expected to submit assignments that are original work and prepared
specifically for the course/section in this academic term. You may not submit work written by
others or “recycle” work prepared for other courses without obtaining written permission from the
instructor(s). Students suspected of engaging in academic misconduct will be reported to the
Office of Academic Integrity.</p>

<p>Other violations of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism,
fabrication (e.g., falsifying data), knowingly assisting others in acts of academic dishonesty, and
any act that gains or is intended to gain an unfair academic advantage.</p>

<p>The impact of academic dishonesty is far-reaching and is considered a serious offense against the
university and could result in outcomes such as failure on the assignment, failure in the course,
suspension, or even expulsion from the university.</p>

<p>For more information about academic integrity see the <a href="https://policy.usc.edu/studenthandbook/">student handbook</a> or the <a href="https://academicintegrity.usc.edu/">Office of
Academic Integrity’s website</a>, and university policies on <a href="https://policy.usc.edu/research-and-scholarship-misconduct/">Research and Scholarship Misconduct</a>.</p>

<p>Generative AI permitted but limited as follows: In this course, you are permitted to use artificial
intelligence (AI)- powered programs to help you, but only on assignments that explicitly indicate a
permitted use of AI. However:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You should also be aware that AI text generation tools may present incorrect information, biased responses, and incomplete analyses; thus, their answers may not meet the standards of this course.</li>
  <li>To adhere to our university values, you must cite any AI-generated material (e.g., text, images, and other content) included or referenced in your work and provide the prompts used to generate the content. Using an AI tool to generate content without proper attribution will be treated as plagiarism and reported to the Office of Academic Integrity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please review the instructions in each assignment for more details on how and when to use AI Generators for your submissions.</p>

      </h3>
    

<p>USC has policies that prohibit recording and distribution of any synchronous and asynchronous
course content outside of the learning environment.</p>

<p>Recording a university class without the express permission of the instructor and announcement
to the class, or unless conducted pursuant to an Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS)
accommodation. Recording can inhibit free discussion in the future, and thus infringe on the
academic freedom of other students as well as the instructor. (<a href="https://policy.usc.edu/studenthandbook/">Living our Unifying Values: The USC
Student Handbook</a>, page 13).</p>

<p>Distribution or use of notes, recordings, exams, or other intellectual property, based on university
classes or lectures without the express permission of the instructor for purposes other than
individual or group study. This includes but is not limited to providing materials for distribution by
services publishing course materials. This restriction on unauthorized use also applies to all
information, which had been distributed to students or in any way had been displayed for use in
relation to the class, whether obtained in class, via email, on the internet, or via any other media.

<p>Academic life exposes students to many challenges, both personal and professional, that may affect their capabilities to learn. Some of these can result in increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. It is encouraged to receive support if you experience such challenges. Your mental health and well-being is not something to be compromised during your academic life. USC offers many resources for support, which I list below:</p>
